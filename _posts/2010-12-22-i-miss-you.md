# I Miss You :'(

Now when I m leaving you<br/>
I feel so weirdly strange<br/>
Speculating what would happen<br/>
And how my life would change.<br/>
<br/>
These thoughts might seem new to you<br/>
but for me they have become a trend<br/>
Coz since I have known you<br/>
you were always more than jus a friend<br/>
<br/>
Many eras have passed since we last met<br/>
yet your memories seem to be so fresh<br/>
Even distant u seem so close<br/>
that I feel as if u were engraved in my flesh.<br/>
<br/>
I remember the time we spent together<br/>
the time we spent chatting beside the window<br/>
Is the way I held u that would I miss<br/>
or is it the warmth of ur shadow<br/>
<br/>
We don't realise how people miss each other<br/>
unless we ourselves miss someone so dear<br/>
Today when I see people with their close ones<br/>
I only know how much I wish u were here<br/>
<br/>
I know people will think I have gone nuts<br/>
coz these feelings are not explainable by logic<br/>
But I know these feelings can bring u back<br/>
coz these are no less than magic<br/>
<br/>
When I look at the birds in the sky<br/>
you don't know how much I feel to cry<br/>
Oh! how much I long to be with you<br/>
and like free birds we would fly.<br/>
<br/>
A sense of nostalgia takes over me<br/>
O how much I wish to hug you<br/>
Now I don't think there is any point guessing the last line<br/>
Which is surely 'I MISS YOU'.<br/>
