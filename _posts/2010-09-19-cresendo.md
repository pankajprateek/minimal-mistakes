# When I entered my room all I saw was red

The incident I describe took place some years back<br/>
When the government administration had begun to slack<br/>
Happiness, love and brotherhood were lost somewhere<br/>
Just the news of riots and murders were everywhere<br/>
To discuss the remedies of these<br/>
People were invited to a five star hotel cheeze<br/>
We discussed many petty issues during the meet<br/>
While we were being served snacks, coke and meat<br/>
There the clocks ticked faster than we had ever dreamt<br/>
Still we couldn't come to a decision that really meant<br/>
Yearning for freedom from that surrounding gloom<br/>
I left the discussion and walked to a room<br/>
All i saw there was red<br/>
Be it the floor or the bedThe walls were painted bloody red<br/>
All this gave me an awkward feeling that someone had bled<br/>
To ease my mind I walked across the room<br/>
And as I did so I felt getting sucked in some gloom<br/>
As such thoughts continued to creep<br/>
I didn't realise when I was hunted down by sleep<br/>
In that sleep i had a dream<br/>
Which came with a faint gleam<br/>
In it a dwarf came<br/>
Horlicks was his name<br/>
He made me realise<br/>
The pain of the sufferers and empathise<br/>
But Oh! suddenly the dwarf disappeared<br/>
As he went i got scared<br/>
For he was followed by a man in cloak<br/>
So scary was he that my dream broke<br/>
Waking up from my dream<br/>
I felt like crying out in a scream<br/>
That the red around me signified my bleeding conscience<br/>
Which I had left somewhere in my journey to find out the mysteries of science<br/>
This incident left me unbiased<br/>
On my longing to help the sufferers of riots<br/>
That's all I want to say<br/>
To all my friends who love to live and play<br/>
I ask you to be selfless, loving and kind<br/>
And work for the betterment of mankind<br/>
Stand up to remove the evils that lead to riots and discrimination<br/>
For in that way you will be contributing for the development of your nation<br/>
