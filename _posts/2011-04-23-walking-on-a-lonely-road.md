# Walking on a Lonely Road

Amid all loneliness and silence that surrounds<br/>
Its you that I feel around<br/>
For though you are not with me today<br/>
your love haunts me all along.<br/>
<br/>
This day long loneliness, though killing<br/>
has turned for me into an eternal bliss<br/>
For its only for those moments<br/>
That I can silently feel your presence that I so dearly miss.<br/>
<br/>
These feelings might seem new to you<br/>
but for me these have become a life<br/>
This loneliness created by your void<br/>
has turned me into an heartless droid.<br/>
<br/>
I loved you since the day we met<br/>
and all I got in return was betrayal<br/>
You might have thought it as a lie<br/>
but this love, I promise would never die.<br/>
<br/>
I don’t complain of this loneliness<br/>
for this is the only gift of you that I have<br/>
But still love! Is thy heart so tough<br/>
that you defy all feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t you remember that once you too used to love me<br/>
or the promises we had made<br/>
Don’t you yearn for the time we spent together<br/>
or the castles we made.<br/>
<br/>
Were those castles so weak to fall so suddenly<br/>
or our love, so profound it used to seem, was so shady<br/>
I accept there were mistakes<br/>
but couldn’t they have been repented.<br/>
<br/>
I know you too long for me<br/>
That you also want us back again<br/>
So love! Why you still keep a rough heart<br/>
while both our souls live a life in pain.<br/>
<br/>
Come forward and hold my hand<br/>
and again be mine<br/>
Lets get back together again<br/>
and fill our lives with a new sunshine.<br/>
<br/>
