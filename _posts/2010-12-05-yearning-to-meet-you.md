# Yearning to meet you

Years have passed since we last met<br/>
Making those promises we hoped would be kept<br/>
Of those happy times we spent together<br/>
Those ecstatic memories which will remain forever.<br/>
<br/>
That lip talking and chit-passing during classes<br/>
Bunking classes to get away from masses<br/>
Watching movies was never so much fun<br/>
That hanging out in the winter sun.<br/>
<br/>
O! how shall I tell you how much I miss those times<br/>
Those memories which get buried away as life hums its chimes<br/>
O! how shall I tell you how much I yearn to meet you<br/>
Yearning for those times when it would be just me and you.<br/>
<br/>
I accept there had been mistakes<br/>
Mistakes which tore us apart<br/>
But you would too agree on the amount of energy it takes<br/>
To rip two loving souls to their very last.<br/>
<br/>
I find lack of words in telling how much I miss you<br/>
Or expressing the limits to which I yearn to meet you<br/>
O love! Forget thy mistakes and forgive mine<br/>
And hope we are able to vanish this deep ravine.<br/>
